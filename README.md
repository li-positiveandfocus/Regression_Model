# Regression_Model
Built regression model to identify the factors of determining house price with R programming

This project develops a regression model with Square feet living space, Square feet lot size, Floors, the number of bathrooms and bedrooms, and Waterfront & views that is capable of identifying the most relevant factors of determining house prices.

This project also intends to understand the causal relationship of these factors to answer our business question and hypothesis. In particular, the model shows how living space size impacts house prices.

Hypothesis Question:
Is living space size a factor in determining house prices?

Ho: There is no relationship between living space size and house price.

Ha: Larger living space size generally increases house prices.\
       Dependent variable: House price\
       Independent variable:\
            Variable of interest: sqrt_lving - square feet of living space\
	 Control variables: sqrt_lot, floors, # of bedrooms, # of bathrooms, waterfront&views.
